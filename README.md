# DD2387 Programsystemkonstruktion med C++

The assignments are to be solved individually. Do not edit any files in this folder. Make your changes in the corresponding subdirectories 01, 02 etc
Every assignment requires an oral presentation where you shall be able to explain and answer questions regarding your solutions.

Before the oral presentation there are questions that shall be answered in writing before the oral presentation. Fill out the questions/answer file Q_A_01.md in the subdirectory.

## General Requirements

* Your code should be modularized in classes and files.

* Make sure that your implementations is easy to read, maintain, and understand.
This includes the usage of correct indentation, as well as having suitable names
for your variables.

* Your implementations must not leak memory, or any other acquired resource.
Pay attention to the purpose of constructors, and their relationship with the corresponding destructor: Resource Acquisition Is Initialization

    advised to check so that your results have been reported correctly. If results 
    are missing in rapp you must contact the course leader and
    present your signed report receipt.

## Kattis

Some assignments require you to submit code for automatic testing, which will
verify that your implementation is correct in relation to the requirements set
forth by the assignment in question.

To submit an implementation for automatic testing, open up a web browser and
point it to \url{https://kth.kattis.com}, then;


*  authenticate using your KTH-id, if this is the first time you are using
    _Kattis_ you must register for the service after signing in, also;
